Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every
time a team member commits changes to version control. CI encourages developers to share
their code and unit tests by merging their changes into a shared version control repository after
every small task completion. Committing code triggers an automated build system to grab the
latest code from the shared repository and to build, test, and validate the full master branch
(also known as the trunk or main).
